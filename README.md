## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

{The main analysis of our group is the adult incomes. Our analysis data will eventually show whether the income of adults is related to their birthplace, gender, occupation, etc. This is also a point that interests us very much. We all want to understand that different people have different status and characteristics, and whether they have a large income gap. Besides, we will further explore the reasons that affect adult income. We are curious about the relationship between adult education level and income. We think that when exploring income, it will be related to academic qualifications, but we don’t know how much academic qualifications will affect a person’s income. I think at the end of this lesson, if you want to make a dashboard, it will be a big project. We need to read a lot of data and draw many different data graphs so that users can easily understand our data information. However, we will go all out to complete this dashboard.}
