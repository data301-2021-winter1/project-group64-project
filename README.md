## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

Bike sharing systems are new generation of traditional bike rentals where whole process from membership, rental and return 
back has become automatic. Through these systems, user is able to easily rent a bike from a particular position and return 
back at another position. Currently, there are about over 500 bike-sharing programs around the world which is composed of 
over 500 thousands bicycles. Today, there exists great interest in these systems due to their important role in traffic, 
environmental and health issues. 

Apart from interesting real world applications of bike sharing systems, the characteristics of data being generated by
these systems make them attractive for the research. Opposed to other transport services such as bus or subway, the duration
of travel, departure and arrival position is explicitly recorded in these systems. This feature turns bike sharing system into
a virtual sensor network that can be used for sensing mobility in the city. Hence, it is expected that most of important
events in the city could be detected via monitoring these data.

The core data set is related to:

1. The two-year historical log corresponding to years 2011 and 2012 from Capital Bikeshare system, Washington D.C.,
2. Weather information from http://www.freemeteo.com
3. Holiday information from http://dchr.dc.gov/page/holiday-schedule. 

The dataset has the following fields"
	
	- instant: record index
	- dteday : date
	- season : season (1:springer, 2:summer, 3:fall, 4:winter)
	- yr : year (0: 2011, 1:2012)
	- mnth : month ( 1 to 12)
	- hr : hour (0 to 23)
	- holiday : weather day is holiday or not (extracted from http://dchr.dc.gov/page/holiday-schedule)
	- weekday : day of the week
	- workingday : if day is neither weekend nor holiday is 1, otherwise is 0.
	+ weathersit : 
		- 1: Clear, Few clouds, Partly cloudy, Partly cloudy
		- 2: Mist + Cloudy, Mist + Broken clouds, Mist + Few clouds, Mist
		- 3: Light Snow, Light Rain + Thunderstorm + Scattered clouds, Light Rain + Scattered clouds
		- 4: Heavy Rain + Ice Pallets + Thunderstorm + Mist, Snow + Fog
	- temp : Normalized temperature in Celsius. The values are divided to 41 (max)
	- atemp: Normalized feeling temperature in Celsius. The values are divided to 50 (max)
	- hum: Normalized humidity. The values are divided to 100 (max)
	- windspeed: Normalized wind speed. The values are divided to 67 (max)
	- casual: count of casual users
	- registered: count of registered users
	- cnt: count of total rental bikes including both casual and registered


## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

We would like to apply data analytics technique to analyse the above dataset. We'd like to 
know when and where bike demand soars and otherwise. It is important to explore other factors related to bike demand. 
Understanding these relations allows us to build a robust predictive model for bike demand. 

Basically, we are interested in the following questions:

1. Where do riders like to go?

2. What time do they like to ride? 

3. What day of the week do they like to ride? 

4. What month do they like to ride? 

5. What weather conditions see high demand for bikes ?

6. How does the demand change over time ?

7. Are most riders registered users?
