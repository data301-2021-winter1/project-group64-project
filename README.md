## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

{Our theme is adult income. Our data comes from UCI Machine Learning company. This is a dataset updated five years ago. It mainly contains data for Adult Census Income, including Predict whether income exceeds $50K/yr based on census data. Our main purpose is to learn more in the future. During the analysis of this project, we will definitely search a lot of information, and we will learn more or less some financial or political knowledge. And in the end, it can also solve some of the problems we want to know, which will be very attractive to us. Our main source of data is the Internet, and there will be some free datasets on the Internet that can be copied at will. We will filter these data in more detail, and finally use the useful data to make a dashboard.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77290527/136481015-a61b45ea-8b43-4f29-8718-145c6454d302.png)

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

{The main analysis of our group is the adult incomes. Our analysis data will eventually show whether the income of adults is related to their birthplace, gender, occupation, etc. This is also a point that interests us very much. We all want to understand that different people have different status and characteristics, and whether they have a large income gap. Besides, we will further explore the reasons that affect adult income. We are curious about the relationship between adult education level and income. We think that when exploring income, it will be related to academic qualifications, but we don’t know how much academic qualifications will affect a person’s income. I think at the end of this lesson, if you want to make a dashboard, it will be a big project. We need to read a lot of data and draw many different data graphs so that users can easily understand our data information. However, we will go all out to complete this dashboard.}
